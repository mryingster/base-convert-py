Description
-----------
Convert is a python script that can convert between bin, oct, dec, and hex. Links to the script need to be created for the following names:
 * bin2oct
 * bin2dec
 * bin2hex
 * oct2bin
 * oct2dec
 * oct2hex
 * dec2bin
 * dec2oct
 * dec2hex
 * hex2bin
 * hex2oct
 * hex2dec

The script determines the conversion mode based upon the script name, `sys.argv[0]`.
